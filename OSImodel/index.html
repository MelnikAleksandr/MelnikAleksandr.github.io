  <h1>SESSION LAYER</h1>
  <p style="color:black;">n the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, the session layer is layer 5.

The session layer provides the mechanism for opening, closing and managing a session between end-user application processes, i.e., a semi-permanent dialogue. Communication sessions consist of requests and responses that occur between applications. Session-layer services are commonly used in application environments that make use of remote procedure calls (RPCs).

An example of a session-layer protocol is the OSI protocol suite session-layer protocol, also known as X.225 or ISO 8327. In case of a connection loss this protocol may try to recover the connection. If a connection is not used for a long period, the session-layer protocol may close it and re-open it. It provides for either full duplex or half-duplex operation and provides synchronization points in the stream of exchanged messages.[1]</p>

    <h2>Protocols?</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)</h2>
    <p>Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) is a password-based authentication protocol used by Point to Point Protocol (PPP) to validate users. Almost all network operating system remote servers support PAP.
PAP is considered a weak authentication scheme (weak schemes are simple and have lighter computational overhead but are much more vulnerable to attack; while weak schemes may have limited application in some constrained environments, they are avoided in general). Among PAP's deficiencies is the fact that it transmits unencrypted passwords over the network. PAP is therefore used only as a last resort when the remote server does not support a stronger scheme such as CHAP or EAP.</p>
    <h2>Structured Query Language (SQL)</h2>
    <p>SQL is by definition a language for querying and accessing data in databases, which includes transaction management to keep the database consistent. I think SQL fits in L5 because of the fact that it involves setting up and maintaining sessions (between the host issuing queries and the database server) and it uses the concept of transactions.</p>
